/** AZSRequestOptions contains options used for requests that are common to all requests.
 
 AZSRequestOptions is used for configuring the behavior of the Azure Storage Client Library.
 Defaults will be used if any options that are not set, or if a RequestOptions object
 is not provided.
 
 AZSRequestOptions is distinguished from AZSOperationContext classes because the AZSOperationContext represents
 the results from an entire operation and will be populated throughout the operation, while the
 AZSRequestOptions is a set of options that governs how the library makes requests.  AZSRequestOptions instances
 can be reused freely in multiple operations, AZSOperationContext instances should not be.
 
 This class should never be directly instantiated, only subclasses:
 
 - AZSBlobRequestOptions

 Internally, the Azure Storage Client requires a runloop to process any downloaded data.  This applies to all operations that 
 return a body from the service, not just direct blob downloads.  If this is set, then this will be the runloop used to download
 the response.  If this property is nil, the storage client will spin up a new thread and run a runloop on that thread for this purpose.
 
 @warning Note that if this property is set, the caller is responsible for ensuring that the runloop is running.  If the runloop is not
 running, behavior is undefined; in most cases the operation will never complete.
